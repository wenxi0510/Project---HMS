# Hospital Management System â€“ OOP-Based Healthcare Solution

The Hospital Management System is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project designed to streamline hospital operations by managing patient records, doctor schedules, and appointment bookings. Built using Java, this system follows OOP principles for modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

## Features
- **Patient Management**: Add, update, and retrieve patient records efficiently.
- **Doctor Scheduling**: Assign doctors to patients and manage their availability.
- **Appointment Booking**: Allows patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
- **Billing System**: Generates invoices based on medical services provided.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures secure access for different user roles (patients, doctors, admin).

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java (OOP principles, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing patient and appointment data)
- **GUI**: Java Swing (for a user-friendly interface)

## Usage
- **Admin**: Manages hospital staff, assigns doctors, and oversees operations.
- **Doctors**: View patient records, update diagnoses, and manage appointments.
- **Patients**: Book appointments, view medical history, and receive invoices.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement RESTful APIs for integration with external systems.
- Add AI-driven patient diagnosis suggestions.
- Improve the user interface with modern UI frameworks.
